# TODO

-   [x] get lsp working
-   [x] Pick a C ini parser, [inih](https://github.com/benhoyt/inih)
-   [x] Get sample to compile
-   [x] copy csv and build as a separate project
-   [x] add inih lib
-   [x] read ini from sample file
-   [x] design, follow mapfile
-   [x] look at mapfile for how to read from stdin
-   [x] read ini file and print to stdout: Try reading from stdin(0)
    using normal streams, i.e. fgets, will need to use fdopen on other
    file descriptors as was done for the read builtin
-   [x] parse ini file
-   [x] assign ini file to bash vars
-   [x] rename to ini
-   [x] vendor inih, rather than link?
-   [x] Create an associative array per section
-   [x] Create an associative array of all sections?
-   [x] Remove hard coded `INI`
-   [x] Add support for arbitrary fds, rather than just stdin
-   [x] Error checking, malloc, return vals, etc?
-   [x] Improve help, docs, code comments
-   [x] Push out repo, test cloning
-   [x] Improve comments
-   [ ] Improve testing
-   [ ] Add a simple readme
-   [ ] Ask for feedback oh help-bash
-   [ ] ï¸™
-   [ ] ?
