# TODO

-   [x] get lsp working
-   [x] Pick a C ini parser
    -   [x] inih, picked
    -   [x] <https://github.com/madmurphy/libconfini>
-   [x] Get sample to compile
-   [x] copy csv and build as a separate project
-   [x] add inih lib
-   [x] read ini from sample file
-   [x] design, follow mapfile
-   [x] look at mapfile for how to read from stdin
-   [x] read ini file and print to stdout: Try reading from stdin(0)
    using normal streams, i.e. fgets, will need to use fdopen on other
    file descriptors as was done for the read builtin
-   [x] parse ini file
-   [x] assign ini file to bash vars
-   [x] rename to ini
-   [ ] Create an associative array per section
-   [ ] Create an indexed array of all sections? How would you use this
    in Bash?
-   [ ] make help better
-   [ ] ï¸™

-   [ ] ?
